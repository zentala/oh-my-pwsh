## Task 006 - Contributors Documentation

### Morning - Documentation as Engineer

**Goal:** Create comprehensive CONTRIBUTORS.md with tech stack, Claude Code info, and development workflow.

**User request summary:**
- Explain CLAUDE.md and Claude-specific files are for AI assistant
- Document tech stack with shields.io badges
- Position Claude Code as "junior engineer" / development assistant
- Describe task management system (todo/, runbooks, ADRs)
- Add stability/version badges to README

### Work Done

#### 1. Created Task 006
- **File:** [todo/006-contributors-documentation.md](../../todo/006-contributors-documentation.md)
- **Status:** Active (P2)
- **Scope:** Complete contributors guide with badges, tech stack, workflow

#### 2. Research & Badges
- Researched shields.io badge syntax
- Found stability badges (alpha, beta, stable)
- Decided on badge set: PowerShell, Pester, GitHub Actions, Claude Code, Platform, License

#### 3. Created CONTRIBUTORS.md
- **File:** [CONTRIBUTORS.md](../../CONTRIBUTORS.md)
- **Sections:**
  - 🛠️ Technologies Used (badges table)
  - 📖 Understanding Documentation Structure
  - 🤖 Developing with Claude Code (positioned as junior engineer)
  - ✅ Testing Requirements (fallback testing, coverage targets)
  - 🔨 Development Workflow
  - 📐 Code Style & Conventions
  - 🎯 Design Principles
  - 📚 Key Documentation Files

**Key messaging:**
> "Claude Code is positioned as a junior engineer / development assistant for this project"
> "Even if not using Claude, READ CLAUDE.md for project conventions"

#### 4. Enhanced README.md

**Added stability/version badges:**
```markdown
![Tests](...)
[![Stability](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-alpha-f4d03f.svg)](...)
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1--alpha-blue.svg)](...)
[![PowerShell](https://img.shields.io/badge/PowerShell-7.x-5391FE.svg?logo=powershell&logoColor=white)](...)
[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-Windows-0078D6.svg?logo=windows&logoColor=white)](...)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](...)
```

**Improved intro based on CLAUDE.md design principles:**
- New section: "🎯 For Linux Users Migrating to Windows"
- Speaks directly to target users (power users, ex-Linux users)
- Shows value proposition: painless migration, preserve habits, learn PowerShell, discover ecosystem
- Mentions Oh My Posh as "PowerShell's answer to oh-my-zsh"
- Changed "appreciate visibility" → "you control your environment" (more empowering)

#### 5. Created LICENSE
- **File:** [LICENSE](../../LICENSE)
- **Type:** MIT License with ALPHA SOFTWARE NOTICE
- **Disclaimer includes:**
  - Alpha stage warning
  - Tested only on maintainer's machine
  - APIs may change
  - Not a PowerShell specialist - learning project
  - For power users who want to collaborate
  - Use at your own risk

#### 6. Created Backlog Task: Smart Editor Suggestions
- **File:** [todo/backlog/007-smart-editor-suggestions.md](../../todo/backlog/007-smart-editor-suggestions.md)
- **Concept:** Detect when user types missing Linux editor commands (`vim`, `ee`, `nano`) and suggest Windows alternatives (`nvim`, `micro`, `nano`) with interactive installation
- **Architecture:** Uses PowerShell's `CommandNotFoundAction` hook
- **User Story:** "When I type `ee` out of habit, suggest `micro` (similar editor) and offer one-click install"
- **Added to README:** "Smart suggestions _(Coming Soon)_" in Linux-Style Experience section

### Files Modified

- [CONTRIBUTORS.md](../../CONTRIBUTORS.md) - NEW
- [LICENSE](../../LICENSE) - NEW
- [README.md](../../README.md) - Added badges, improved intro, added "Coming Soon" feature
- [todo/006-contributors-documentation.md](../../todo/006-contributors-documentation.md) - NEW
- [todo/backlog/007-smart-editor-suggestions.md](../../todo/backlog/007-smart-editor-suggestions.md) - NEW
- [todo/INDEX.md](../../todo/INDEX.md) - Added tasks 006 and 007
- [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) - Updated active tasks

### Decisions Made

1. **Stability Badge:** Alpha (yellow `#f4d03f`)
   - Communicates: "works for maintainer, but in active development"
   - Links to standard stability badges documentation

2. **Version Badge:** 0.0.1-alpha
   - Preparing for first release
   - Makes it clear this is pre-1.0

3. **LICENSE Approach:** MIT with custom ALPHA NOTICE header
   - Standard MIT provides "AS IS" warranty disclaimer
   - Custom notice adds context about alpha stage, learning project, power user audience

4. **README Intro:** User-focused messaging
   - Speaks to target user pain points (missing bash/zsh)
   - Shows value proposition upfront
   - Educational tone (learning project, not expert)

5. **Smart Suggestions:** Backlog for now
   - Great DevEx feature aligned with "discovering PowerShell ecosystem"
   - Uses `CommandNotFoundAction` hook (PowerShell 7.4+)
   - Non-intrusive, educational, interactive

### Tech Notes

**Shields.io badge syntax:**
```
https://img.shields.io/badge/<LABEL>-<MESSAGE>-<COLOR>.svg?logo=<LOGO>&logoColor=<COLOR>
```

**PowerShell CommandNotFoundAction:**
- Available in PS 7.4+
- Event fired when command not found
- Can suggest alternatives or create dynamic aliases
- Must set `$CommandLookupEventArgs.StopSearch = $true`

### Next Steps

- [ ] User review of CONTRIBUTORS.md
- [ ] User review of LICENSE disclaimer
- [ ] User review of README changes
- [ ] Decide if we want to implement task 007 (smart suggestions) soon or keep in backlog

### Questions for User

1. Is the LICENSE disclaimer strong enough? Too strong?
2. CONTRIBUTORS.md positioning of Claude Code as "junior engineer" - correct tone?
3. README intro - does it speak to the right audience?
4. Smart suggestions feature - priority? (backlog is P3)
