## Key Decisions Made

1. **Skip 75% overall coverage target** - Prioritized QUALITY over QUANTITY
   - Tier 1 & 2 modules EXCEED targets (95.7% and 87.7%)
   - Critical regression prevention in place
   - 75% would require testing profile.ps1, help-system.ps1, and utility modules

2. **No Codecov for now** - 1 developer, local coverage sufficient
   - GitHub Actions coverage in logs is enough
   - Can revisit when project scales
   - Separate CODECOV-SETUP.md created for future

3. **Builder pattern implemented** - Flexible test configuration
   - `New-TestConfig | Add-NerdFonts | Add-Tools @("bat", "eza")`
   - Makes testing different scenarios easy

4. **Primary goal: Regression prevention** - All fallback scenarios tested
   - 32+ tests for missing dependencies
   - Profile must work with NO tools installed

5. **Test matrix strategy** - Cross-platform and cross-version testing
   - Windows + Ubuntu ensures profile works on both OS
   - PS 7.4 + 7.3 ensures backward compatibility
   - fail-fast: false = all combinations run even if one fails

6. **Critical threshold at 30%** - Pragmatic quality gate
   - Current coverage: 35% (above threshold)
   - Prevents severe coverage regression
   - Not enforcing 75% target (quality over quantity)

## Blockers / Issues

None encountered. All tests passing, coverage tracking working.

---

## Next Steps

**Phase 3 (CI/CD) - ✅ COMPLETED**

**Remaining Phases:**

**Option A: Phase 4 (Developer Experience)** - Estimated 2 hours
- Git hooks (optional pre-commit)
- Test scaffolding tools (`New-TestFile.ps1`)
- Watch mode for tests

**Option B: Phase 5 (E2E & Advanced)** - Estimated 2-3 hours
- E2E tests for full profile loading
- Performance benchmarks
- Advanced coverage analysis

**Option C: Continue to 75% overall coverage** - Estimated 2-3 hours
- Add tests for profile.ps1, help-system.ps1
- Increase utility module coverage

**Recommendation:** Phase 3 complete! Consider Phase 4 (Developer Experience) next for better developer workflow, or move on to other project priorities since core testing infrastructure is in place and working automatically.
